## Introduction

This is the Git repository for the Node.js Twitter Microservice module for the **Oracle Public Cloud DevOps Cloud Native Microservices-DB Workshop.** There are no dependencies for this Node.js module.  The main js file for this Node.js module is server.js.  This module performs three very simple functions:
- First server.js reads a JSON file (SampleTweets.json).
- Secondly the server.js code then filters this result set and reformats it into JSON (subset of the original JSON).
- Lastly server.js writes this JSON to the web.
